# Part 01 - GET Method

Path parameters are declared in both the path (using braces) and as an argument
to the path operation function. Query parameters are declared as arguments to
the path operation function, but are not declared in the path.

Type hints can be used for automatic type validation. Optional parameters have
default values assigned to them.

You can use enums to declare path parameters or query parameters that have
determined values. Extend both enum and the type of the values for automatic
type validation.
